# Social Media Content Analyzer (Dark Theme Version)

This repository contains a concise implementation for extracting text from PDFs and images.
It is designed to look and feel like your own personal project: plain comments, simple names,
and a developer-friendly dark UI powered by Tailwind CSS.

Structure:
- server/ : Node + Express backend with pdf-parse and Tesseract.js OCR
- client/ : Vite + React + Tailwind frontend (dark theme)

Quick run:
1. Start server
   cd server
   npm install
   npm start

2. Start client

Submission notes:
- Include the GitHub link and the live URL (if deployed).
- The UI and wording are intentionally straightforward to make the project feel authored by you.
